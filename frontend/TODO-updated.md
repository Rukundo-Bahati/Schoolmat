# School Manager Settings Page Integration - Updated Progress

## Overview
Integrate the settings page of the school manager dashboard with appropriate backend endpoints. Replace inline settings with the SettingsTab component and implement missing backend APIs.

## Tasks

### 1. Backend Implementation
- [x] Explore existing SchoolInfoModule and extend if needed
- [ ] Create SettingsModule for business settings, notifications, payment methods, system preferences
- [ ] Implement endpoints for:
  - School information (GET/PUT /school-info)
  - Business settings (GET/PUT /settings/business)
  - Notification preferences (GET/PUT /settings/notifications)
  - Payment methods (GET/PUT /settings/payments)
  - System preferences (GET/PUT /settings/system)
  - Data export (POST /settings/export)
  - System reset (POST /settings/reset)
- [x] Add change password endpoint to auth controller (PATCH /auth/change-password)
- [ ] Create DTOs for all settings entities
- [ ] Update database entities if needed

### 2. Frontend API Integration
- [x] Update lib/api.ts with new API functions (created separate settings-api.ts)
- [x] Add API calls for all settings endpoints
- [x] Handle authentication and error responses

### 3. Frontend Component Updates
- [x] Replace inline settings in app/school-manager/page.tsx with SettingsTab component (created settings-tab-updated.tsx)
- [x] Update SettingsTab component to use API calls instead of mock handlers
- [x] Add loading states and error handling
- [x] Implement form validation and success messages

### 4. Testing
- [ ] Test all settings endpoints with Postman/API client
- [ ] Test frontend integration with backend
- [ ] Verify authentication and authorization
- [ ] Test error scenarios and edge cases

## Current Status
- SettingsTab component exists with UI but uses mock handlers
- SchoolInfoModule exists but needs verification
- Users controller supports profile updates
- Auth controller now has change password endpoint
- Settings API functions created in lib/settings-api.ts
- SettingsTab component updated with API integration (settings-tab-updated.tsx)
- Change password backend implementation completed
- Frontend API integration completed with proper error handling

## Next Steps
1. Create SettingsModule and related entities/DTOs
2. Implement all required settings endpoints
3. Test the complete integration
4. Replace the original settings-tab.tsx with the updated version
