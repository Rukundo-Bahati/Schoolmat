# 📸 Image Migration to Cloudinary Guide

This guide will help you migrate all product and category images from local storage to Cloudinary.

## 🔧 Prerequisites

1. **Cloudinary Account**: You need a Cloudinary account. Sign up at [cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com) if you don't have one.
2. **Environment Variables**: Ensure these are set in your backend `.env` file:
   ```bash
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-api-key
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-api-secret
   CLOUDINARY_FOLDER=schoolmart
   ```

## 🚀 Migration Steps

### Step 1: Verify Cloudinary Configuration

Before running the migration, verify your Cloudinary configuration:

```bash
cd backend
npm run verify:cloudinary
```

This will check:
- ✅ Environment variables are set
- ✅ Cloudinary credentials are valid
- ✅ Connection to Cloudinary is working

### Step 2: Run Image Migration

Once verification passes, run the migration script:

```bash
npm run migrate:images
```

This script will:
1. **Upload all images** from `frontend/public/` to Cloudinary
2. **Update database records** with new Cloudinary URLs
3. **Store Cloudinary public IDs** for future management
4. **Handle errors gracefully** with detailed logging

### Step 3: Verify Migration Results

After migration completes:

1. **Check the console output** for any errors
2. **Verify images load** by visiting your application
3. **Check database records** to confirm URLs are updated

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "Missing Cloudinary configuration"
**Solution**: Set your environment variables:
```bash
# Windows (Command Prompt)
set CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
set CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-api-key
set CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-api-secret

# Windows (PowerShell)
$env:CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="your-cloud-name"
$env:CLOUDINARY_API_KEY="your-api-key"
$env:CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET="your-api-secret"
```

#### 2. "File not found" errors
**Solution**: Ensure all image files exist in `frontend/public/` folder

#### 3. "Cloudinary upload failed"
**Solution**: 
- Check your Cloudinary account limits
- Verify API credentials are correct
- Ensure you have upload permissions

#### 4. Database connection issues
**Solution**: Ensure your database is running and connection details are correct

### Manual Verification

You can manually verify the migration by checking:

1. **Cloudinary Dashboard**: Check if images appear in your Cloudinary account
2. **Database Query**: Run this SQL to verify URLs:
   ```sql
   SELECT name, imageUrl FROM categories LIMIT 5;
   SELECT name, imageUrl FROM products LIMIT 5;
   ```

3. **Frontend Test**: Check if images load correctly in your application

## 🔙 Rollback Plan

If you need to rollback the migration:

1. **Restore from backup** (if you have database backup)
2. **Manual update**: Run SQL queries to restore original paths
3. **Delete from Cloudinary**: Use Cloudinary dashboard to remove uploaded images

## 📝 Next Steps After Migration
